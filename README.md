# ECM3412 - Coursework Exercise by Sebastian Dixon

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for city networks of Burma and Brazil. The goal is to find an optimal path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing the total travel distance.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python 3 libraries:

1. **xml.etree.ElementTree:**
   - This library is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

2. **random:**
   - This library is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

3. **matplotlib:**
   - Install matplotlib using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

4. **pandas:**
   - Install pandas using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

5. **numpy:**
   - Install numpy using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy
     ```

6. **networkx:**
   - Install networkx using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install networkx
     ```

## Usage

To use this ACO algorithm implementation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SebastianDixon/TravellingSalesman_ACO.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd TravellingSalesman_ACO
   ```

3. Run the Python script containing the ACO algorithm implementation.
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

Make sure to replace "your_script_name.py" with the name of the Python script you want to execute.
